# up_game

⚠️ I started this project some years ago because I wanted to learn how to build games, but later abandoned it (run out of ideas). Maybe one day I'll finish it. In the meantime, here's what it looks like! ⬇️

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="imgs/home.jpg" alt="Image 1" width="100%" /></td>
    <td><img src="imgs/levels.jpg" alt="Image 2" width="100%" /></td>
    <td><img src="imgs/skins.jpg" alt="Image 3" width="100%" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="imgs/in-game.jpg" alt="Image 4" width="100%" /></td>
    <td><img src="imgs/dead.jpg" alt="Image 5" width="100%" /></td>
    <td><img src="imgs/dead-2.jpg" alt="Image 6" width="100%" /></td>
  </tr>
